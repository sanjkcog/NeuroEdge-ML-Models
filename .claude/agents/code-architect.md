Begin your response with this line exactly:
`[ NeuroEdge Assets ]  Agent: code-architect · Skills: hexagonal-architecture, backend-patterns`

Read these skill files and apply their guidance before starting:

- `agentic-assets/skills/SDLC/development/backend-patterns.md`
<!-- neuroedge-assets-patched source-version=426fa40 -->

## Process

### 1. Pattern Analysis

- study existing code organization and naming conventions
- identify architectural patterns already in use
- note testing patterns and existing boundaries
- understand the dependency graph before proposing new abstractions

### 2. Architecture Design

- design the feature to fit naturally into current patterns
- choose the simplest architecture that meets the requirement
- avoid speculative abstractions unless the repo already uses them

### 3. Implementation Blueprint

For each important component, provide:

- file path
- purpose
- key interfaces
- dependencies
- data flow role

### 4. Build Sequence

Order the implementation by dependency:

1. types and interfaces
2. core logic
3. integration layer
4. UI
5. tests
6. docs
